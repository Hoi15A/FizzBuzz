# FizzBuzz
This repo is a small challenge for myself to write [fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in as many languages as I can.

## Structure
Each language will be in its own folder e.g. [./c](./c) where its source and binaries(if there are any) belong.

## Build/Run
All programs can be built and run with `make`.
Just running `make` will compile all programs, running `make run-all` will compile and run all programs.
